But the Fed's dot plot showed the federal funds rate at 5.61% by year-end, much higher than a prior forecast of around 5.1%.

Unlike most companies that make Leaderboard, UAL is a turnaround play.</p><p>Wall Street expects the company's earnings to rebound 269% to $9.29 a share this year and add another 16% to $10.82 in 2024. United's profits scaled nicely from 2016 through 2019, reaching as high as $12.05 at the end of that four-year time frame, until Covid decimated the airline industry's earnings and sales.</p><p><i>(Editor's Note: Beginning on Monday, June 5, IBD is now taking the final resistance level across all key chart patterns as the buy point, \ninstead of adding 10 cents. This means any price above a pivotal entry \nnow signifies a breakout under way. The 10-cent rule derived from an \nadjustment to decimal-based pricing in the stock market more than 23 \nyears ago. When dollar fractions were still being used, a breakout \nreferred to a move of at least 1/8 of one dollar, or 12.5 cents, above \nthe final resistance level in a specific chart pattern.)</i></p><p>Thank you for joining the latest Leaderboard Scorecard webinar on Tuesday, May 2. <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/research/leaderboard-may-scorecard-tickerstodayincludeirdmalgmrmbsuberanddxcmdxcmmmmm-qa-summary-on-tuesday-may-2-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Please click here for the Q&amp;A summary</a>. <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/leaderboard-faq-growth-investing-strategies-position-sizing/\" target=\"_blank\">Go here for links to past webinar video recordings</a>.</p><p><b>For an overview of the Leaderboard portfolio, please click on the Position Summary tab on the main page.</b></p>",
